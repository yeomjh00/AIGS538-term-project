# Sequence
1. image classification -> (modularization Augmentation)
	-> weight, gradient, ect... (e.g. batch norm)
2. gradient inversion

main (get args from args.py)
	- train or get trained model
	- get weight, gradient, etc...
	- GradInv(can be done through various attack methods)
	- store/comparison

# TODO
measure trained model
ideas for new augmentation
- maybe, non-linear boundary with mixup (stair function-like shape) works.
